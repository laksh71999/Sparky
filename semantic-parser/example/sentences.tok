The desert is dry and hot . 
<<<<<<< HEAD
There is little water in the desert . 
The only plant in the desert is the cactus . 
Camels can be in the sun all day . 
Camels do n't need water . 
When people think of a desert , they usually think of a sandy , hot , and dry place . 
Very few plants or animals live in desert areas . 
Deserts are huge dry areas with very little plants , a couple of camels thrown in and miles and miles of sand . 
Most deserts are very dry and they donâ€™t get rain .
